The film, produced by P. A. Kameshwara Rao, deals with reincarnation as the subject where the lead roles get killed for their romance and then they are shown to be reborn again and fall in love yet again in the backdrop of inter-faith marriage. The dialogues and lyrics were written by Chi. Udaya Shankar. The film was received exceptionally well at the box office and was one of the biggest hits of 1984. This was the first Kannada movie to show a computer on-screen. The director remade the movie in the same year in Telugu as Vasantha Geetam.",
