The television film of the same name, directed by Zdeněk Zelenka, tells the story of the eternal fluctuation of justice between truth and its outward appearance. It focuses on a case of judicial error, the victim of which is a young nurse, Genevieve Leblanc. She is accused of giving a lethal injection to her lover, government advisor Dupré. In the court investigation, two prominent lawyers clash: Judge Gaudet, who gradually becomes convinced that the girl is innocent, and attorney Cassidis, who elegantly manipulates witnesses, facts, and words.",
