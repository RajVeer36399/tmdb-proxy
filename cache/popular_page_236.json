Among the guests, names of the traditional \"samba-school\" Portela and ex-partners. Also, the presence of a black hat on an empty chair, represents the composer himself, who died in 1999, after a life of many accomplishments in music, and appearance in three of Dos Santos's films: \"Rio, 40 Graus\", \"Rio Zona Norte\" and \"Boca de Ouro\".",
