Even the local church struggles just to keep the lights on because of its barely-existent congregation's lack of enthusiasm. However, all this begins to change when a mysterious pastor arrives to lead the church. With his faith in hand and God by his side, Pastor Miguel sets out to inspire the community into action, empower the youth, and ultimately to re-ignite the community's faith in God.",
