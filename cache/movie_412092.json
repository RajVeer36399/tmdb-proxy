He tries to avoid seeing her by going to a different academy and that's when his mother introduces him to her friend Soo-yeon, a sophisticated and intelligent looking woman. Gwang-ho falls for her.  Gwang-ho's mother suddenly leaves for Australia because his father is sick and Gwang-ho gets to stay in Soo-yeon's house for a few days. Looking at her, he thinks of all the things he would like to do with her and Soo-yeon's niece Ha-kyeong stimulates him to do something about his feelings.",
